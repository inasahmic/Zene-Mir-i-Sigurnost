              <p>This page serves to inform about the activities undertaken by the MoD of BiH and the AF of BiH on the affirmation and implementation of gender equality, as well as the improvement of the status and greater representation of women in defense institutions. It also contains information on international and domestic regulations that are crucial and relevant to achieving gender equality.
                </p>
              <p>The MoD of BiH gives full support in the implementation of gender equality, because it is viewed from the point of view of operational efficiency, one of the best ways to achieve equal rights and opportunities, but also the responsibilities of both men and women in the MoD of BiH and AF BiH.</p>

              <h3>Introductory remarks by the Minister of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina</h3>
              <p>Dr. Sifet Podžić</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, along with other processes and activities, pay special attention to the issue of active role of women members of the Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as to gender analysis, raising awareness and promotion of the gender equality in the Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in order, on the one hand, their full affirmation, and on the other hand, to achieve full functionality of defense system in the field of gender equality.</p>
              <p>Gender mainstreaming is a strategy that integrates the experiences and specific needs of men and women into the process of creating, implementing, controlling and evaluating the provisions and programs of the MoD BiH and the AF BiH, so that all members benefit equally from them.</p>
              <p>The participation of women in the armed forces is primarily a human rights issue, and it concerns the right of women to have access to the military profession. This is also a question of non-discrimination, thus equal career opportunities for men and women, equal access to different functions, and the eradication of abuse of women in the armed forces.</p>
              <p>Resolution 1325 is a document of historical significance and requires the participation of women in decision-making processes, peace negotiations and processes, the inclusion of a gender perspective in training for peacekeeping missions, the protection of girls and women during and after conflict and the inclusion of a gender perspective in peacekeeping reporting and work. Resolution 1820 relies on Resolution 1325 and treats sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict situations in a specific way.</p>
              <p>The Action Plans for the implementation of UN Resolution 1325 in BiH define goals and activities, which are of vital importance for the implementation of this Resolution in BiH. The Ministry of Defense of BiH and the Armed Forces of BiH continuously carry out activities in order to execute obligations undertaken from the mentioned plans. The focus of activities is on informing and training members of the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces of BiH, harmonization of regulations and practices in the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces with the Law on Gender Equality and the Law on Prohibition of Discrimination, as well as activities to improve living and working conditions in the Armed Forces. </p>
              <p>As part of the measures to implement Resolution 1325, as well as other international acts in the field of gender equality, ratified by Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces of BiH also joined the WPS CHODs Network. Based on this project, in March 2019, an international conference "Women, Peace and Security" was held in BiH, which resulted in the adoption of concrete conclusions. Based on these conclusions, the Ministry of Defense of BiH formed a working group in June 2019 and a comprehensive Dynamic Plan for the implementation of the conclusions of the Conference was developed.</p>
              <p>In this regard, the MoD and the AF BiH conducted a comprehensive gender audit with specific recommendations and proposals for improving the situation in this area. The subject gender audit was assessed as a unique example in the world by experts in the field of gender equality from the United Kingdom.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Defense implements UN Security Council Resolution 1325 - Women, Peace and Security through cooperation with the Ministry of Human Rights and Refugees - BiH Agency for Gender Equality, NATO Headquarters in Sarajevo, EUFOR Command in BiH, UNDP / SEESAC, OSCE , embassies of partner countries and the non-governmental sector.</p>
              <p>However, the cooperation with the Embassy of the United Kingdom in Sarajevo, is particularly pronounced. The support of Ambassador HE Matthew Field and his staff continues in 2020 and 2021 as part of Phase II, which is implementation of recommendations given in comprehensive gender audit, through professional, material and financial support.</p>

              <h3>Introductory remark by the Chief of the Joint Staff of the AFBiH</h3>
              <p>Leuitenant General Senad Mašović</p>
              <p>Dear visitors of the website "Women, Peace and Security", I am extremely proud that the MoD and AF BiH received such a web application which, in addition to other forms of information and communication, will transmit and present, not only given regulations, but also other important information related to gender equality.</p>
              <p>We are aware of the fact, which decisively influenced, among other things, the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1325, whose anniversary we are celebrating at this time, that a better approach to gender equality is necessary in all countries but certainly to ensure even better protection of women's rights in defense and security institutions.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the commitment of the AF BiH, as before, through a series of activities carried out by the MoD and AF BiH in cooperation with our partners, and especially intensified within the Network of Chiefs of Staff of the AF "Women, Peace and Security" (WPS CHODS Network), to continue to implement subject resolution, but also other international and domestic regulations, through the harmonization of internal regulations, certainly the integration of gender equality issues in training and education, and the improvement of living and working conditions for men and women on the MoD and AF BiH.</p>
              <p>All this is already largely confirmed in practice. Today, the professional attitude of female members of the BiH Armed Forces in the execution of tasks in BiH is evident, but also in peacekeeping missions, who with their male colleagues, represent BiH in the world as the best ambassadors.</p>
              <p>In addition to the above, the implementation of UN Resolution 1325 is also a new impetus in the framework of regional cooperation, and that the AF BiH can in this segment contribute to better understanding and more effective implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution and thus further contribute to prevention sexual violence in conflicts, protection of the most vulnerable categories during conflict and empowerment, as well as raising the number of women in defense and security structures to a higher and more significant level.</p>
